Define two structs:

Course → contains courseName[100] and units (int).

Student → contains studentName[100], idNumber (int), and a nested Course enrolled.

Write functions:

void inputStudent(Student *s) → input student’s name and ID.

void inputCourse(Course *c) → input course name and units.

void enrollStudent(Student *s, Course *c) → assign a course to the student.

void updateCourse(Course *c, char *newCourseName, int newUnits) → update the course details.

void displayStudent(Student *s) → display student’s details and their enrolled course.

In main():

Ask for student info.

Ask for course info.

Enroll the student in the course.

Display student + course info.

Then update the course (use updateCourse).

Display updated info.
